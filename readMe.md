# Webpage Opener Script

This repository contains a simple and short Bash/Zsh script template designed to automatically open a number of webpages in the default web browser. Although the functionality is very straightforward, it could come in handy for someone who periodically check a fixed list of websites. Instead of typing the urls or clicking the bookmarks one by one. A double click on the file will instantly do the job. Best wishes to all!


## Adding New URLs

The script file is `openTabs.command`

To add new URLs, simply insert the URLs into the `webPages` array, separated by spaces.

## Usage

To use the script, download and revise the file, and double-click it.

## Compatibility

Please note: This script is compatible with macOS only.
